This is a very flexible AB-Test framework for django.

It handles Tests, with their experiments, goals and results.

Quick start:
cd example

If you are on windows, you need to edit example/settings.py to change path of db from /tmp/django_ABTest.db to c:\tmp\whatever.

./manage.py syncdb
./manage.py runserver

This should start the project website with docu and live demo.

It should also be hosted here: http://abtest.h0rde.net

Everything in this repository is public domain.

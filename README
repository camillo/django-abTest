This is a very flexible AB-Test framework for django.

It handles Tests, with their experiments, goals and results.

Quick start:
cd example
./manage.py syncdb
./manage.py runserver

This should start the project website with docu and live demo.

It should also be hosted here: http://abtest.h0rde.net

Everything in this repository is public domain.
